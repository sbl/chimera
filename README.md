# chimera synthesis

> Any sound can be mathematically factored into the product of a slowly
> varying envelope (also called modulation), and a rapidly-varying fine time
> structure (also known as carrier).  Our goal is to find out which of the two
> factors, envelope or fine structure, is the most important for auditory
> perception.  To do so, we synthesize novel stimuli which have the envelope
> of one sound and the fine structure of another sound.  We call  these
> stimuli "auditory chimeras" by analogy with the mythological beasts which
> have the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a serpent.

### what?

This is a python implementation of chimera synthesis, as originally
implemented by Bertrand Delgutte in
[matlab](http://research.meei.harvard.edu/chimera/More.html).

### install

- `python setup.py install`

### usage

see jupyter notebook for a usage example
